## Step 2: Arrange application so you can see your domain

Goal: Be able to see application domain in your top level directories <!-- .element: class="current-item" -->

Outcomes:

* Minimizes the number of directories that I have to look through to make changes to a domain concept (aka bounded context). <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-red"  data-fragment-index="1" -->

* Less costly to evolve bounded contexts and experiment with boundaries. <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-red"  data-fragment-index="2" -->

* Delaying architecture decisions. <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-red"  data-fragment-index="3" -->

* Your application could spend some time here as the bounded contexts age and mature...like a fine French wine.<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-red"  data-fragment-index="4" -->
