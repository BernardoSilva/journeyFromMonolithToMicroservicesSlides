## Service Discovery

Goal: Reduce coupling between two applications so that you can easily scale
one or the other.<!-- .element: class="current-item" -->

Outcomes:

* Increased complexity of additional applications to run and monitor.<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-red"  data-fragment-index="1" -->

* Increased flexibility for scaling services due to decoupled discovery.<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-red"  data-fragment-index="2" -->
